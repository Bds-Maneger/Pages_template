# A Simple template to create personalized pages for Bds-Maneger

Rules:

1. As it is html and javascript, the pages cannot contain **any** click tracker or even access, this breaks the privacy situation.

2. Pages should be optimized for devices with different resolutions, cores, and ram. This does not include mobile devices as we are unable to run the official Mojang AB server on ARM processors and not even the electron.

3. javascripts are powered, as long as you do not publish personal information, passwords or anything else you publish or use with malicious intent

4. NodeJS modules cannot be included in the `package.json` of `Bds-Maneger`, but they can be on your page
